# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comes from the Top Football League Scorers dataset. This dataset has player statistics including goals, shots, shots on target, games played, etc for the top football goal scorers across a variety of leagues from 2016 to 2020. 
Dataset: [Top Football League Scorers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/top-football-leagues-scorers)



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

-Which players have scored the most goals?
-Which players are most efficient in scoring goals (more goals with less shots)?
-How have the statistics of players changed over time?
-What leagues have the highest goal scorers?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
