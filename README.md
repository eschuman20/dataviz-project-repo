# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comes from the Top Football League Scorers dataset. This dataset has player statistics including goals, shots, shots on target, games played, etc for the top football goal scorers across a variety of leagues from 2016 to 2020. 
Dataset: [Top Football League Scorers](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedhanyyy/top-football-leagues-scorers)



## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

Which players have scored the most goals?
Which players are most efficient in scoring goals (more goals with less shots)?
How have the statistics of players changed over time?
What leagues have the highest goal scorers?

## Sketches

This is an outline of my proposed viz. There will be four visualizations all connected to each other through interaction. A menu will exist on the side to show different statistics on the graphs (for example change from goals to shots on target). There will also be menu's to filter by year and league.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a couple proof of concept visualizations of this data.

This one shows goal scorers and the number of goals they scored over time.

This one is a scatter plot of the shots and goals for each player in 2018.

And this one is a bar chart showing the top 10 goal scorers in Italy in 2016.

## Open Questions

At the moment my main concern revolves around how to connect the visualizations so that if you click on one, it will cause the others to change. 

## Milestones

Week 8: Create proposal, work on developing current viz's 
Week 9: Create bar chart viz for tracking the goals over time for a specific player
Weeks 10-11: Work on adding interaction across viz's
Week 12: Add a menu to the overall viz so additional stats can be viewed
Weeks 13-14: Final testing and fine tuning
