# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project comes from the Top Football League Scorers dataset. This dataset has player statistics including goals, shots, shots on target, games played, etc for the top football goal scorers across a variety of leagues from 2016 to 2020.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

Which players have scored the most goals?
Which players are most efficient in scoring goals (more goals with less shots)?
How have the statistics of players changed over time?
What leagues have the highest goal scorers?

## Sketches

This is an outline of my proposed viz. There will be four visualizations all connected to each other through interaction. A menu will exist on the side to show different statistics on the graphs (for example change from goals to shots on target). There will also be menu's to filter by year and league.

## Prototypes

Iâ€™ve created a couple proof of concept visualizations of this data.

This one shows player statistics over time.

This one is a scatter plot of player statistics, with menu's to display different statistics and a year filter.

This one is a bar chart showing the top 5 players given a statistic.

And this one is a parallel coordinates plot showing the performances of players across different stats.

## Midterm Reflection

So far I have created all four of the viz's I would like in my final project. While they are all working properly on their own I would like to combine them in one viz, so a user can view and interact with all of them at the same time. This is what I plan to prioritize with for the rest of the course. In addition, there is some fine tuning I can do to make the visuals more visually pleasing, such as editing the column names to make them more readable. 

## Open Questions

At the moment my main concern revolves around how to connect the visualizations so that if you click on one, it will cause the others to change. 

## Milestones

Week 12: Add interaction across viz's
Weeks 13-14: Final testing and fine tuning
